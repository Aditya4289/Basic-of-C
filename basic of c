// double slash are used for commenting in the code. Comments are hints that we add to our program to make our code easier to understand. 
//They are mainly used for humans to read and understand the code.
//semicolon (;) at the end is mandatory in c programming. it indicates the end of the statment 
*keywords

Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to the compiler. Keywords are part of the syntax and they cannot be used as an identifier.
32 reserved keyword for c:
auto, break, case, char, const, continue, enum, if, default, do, double, else, extern, float, for, goto, int, long,
register, return, chart, signed, size of, static, struct, switch, type text, union, unsigned, void, volatile, while 

*Literals
In programming, we will be dealing with different types of data. All these fixed data (values) that we can use directly in our program are called literals.

                                      Different Types of Literals
                                                  |
              |-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
    Integer Literals                    Floating-point Literals               Character Literals
    (Numbers without decimal parts     (No. that have a decimal part        (A single character that is enclosed
     For ex.25, -75, 50)                For ex.21.5, 32.9, 9.0)              within single quotation marks
                                                                             for ex.'Aditya 4289', '4', 'd')
                    
   *Variables
   Variables are containers to store data like numbers and characters
   
   The syntax to declare variables in C programming is:
   int age;    or int main;
   in above example age and main are variable and int is keyword
   we use printf function to print variables in c programming
   %d is used for format specifier
   %if is used for double specifier
   
   *data type
   Data types determine the type of data associated with variables
   1. int type - used for integer values without decimal. for ex 54, -21, 32, etc
   2. double type - used for floating-point numbers with decimal. for ex 51.9, 62.5, etc
   3. char type - used for characters. for ex 'A', '+', etc
